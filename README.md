# practiceQ-my-notebook
GET READY WITH ME!

Welcome to my unofficial interview notebook – where I wrestle with algorithms, argue with Python syntax, and occasionally win.

## What’s inside? 📚

- Classic algorithm challenges (the kind that make you question your life choices)
- Python exercises written with love (and a bit of caffeine)
- Honest comments, random thoughts, and solutions that actually work (sometimes on the first try!)

## Why this repo exists:
Because interviews are hard.  
And preparing for them shouldn’t be boring.

Just be gentle – this is my baby 💅
